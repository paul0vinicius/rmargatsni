This project aims to develop a R Package to fetch Instagram functions based on their [Web API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/).

The resulting product will be published to be used by community in different contexts of data analysis and visualization.

### Endpoints 

Here we wrap the API functions to be used in R language. The existing endpoints are related to:

* [Users](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/users/)
* [Relationships](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/relationships/)
* [Media](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/)
* [Comments](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/comments/)
* [Likes](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/likes/)
* [Tags](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/tags/)
* [Location](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/locations/)
